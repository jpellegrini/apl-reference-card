# A reference card for GNU APL

This is a reference card for [GNU APL](https://www.gnu.org/software/apl/).

This reference card was adapted from `calccard.tex`, which is part of
GNU Emacs. The file `pdflayout.sty` is also part of GNU Emacs, and
was included without modification.

You may get the [PDF file](aplcard.pdf) or build the PDF from the 
source by running `make`.
